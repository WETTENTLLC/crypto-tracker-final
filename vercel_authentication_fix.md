# Resolving 401 Unauthorized Errors on Vercel Deployment

## Problem
Our CryptoTracker application is deployed to Vercel, but all endpoints are returning 401 Unauthorized errors. This is because the Vercel project is set to private, requiring authentication to access.

## Solution
To make the application publicly accessible, you need to update the Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/wettentllcs-projects/crypto-tracker-no-modules
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, find "Privacy" or "Security" settings
4. Disable password protection or set the project visibility to "Public"
5. Save your changes

## Alternative Solution
If you cannot change the privacy settings for your team, you can:

1. Create a new Vercel account that allows public projects
2. Deploy the project to that account instead
3. Use a different hosting provider that allows public access by default (like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or a custom server)

## Verification After Changes
Once you've updated the privacy settings, run the verification script again:
```
node verify-deployment.js
```

## Current Deployment URLs
We've tried several deployments, with the most recent one at:
- https://crypto-tracker-no-modules-jl63k9toj-wettentllcs-projects.vercel.app

All of these deployments have the same 401 authentication issue due to the Vercel account privacy settings.

## Environment Variables
Make sure to update your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard to match your final deployment URL:
