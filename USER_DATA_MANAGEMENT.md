# CryptoTracker: User Data Management Guide

## How User Data is Stored and Managed

CryptoTracker uses a combination of storage approaches to manage user data:

### For Regular Users:

1. **Local Storage**
   - Basic preferences and settings
   - Authentication tokens 
   - Premium status flag
   - Selected cryptocurrencies for tracking

2. **Cookies**
   - Session information
   - User preferences
   - Theme settings

3. **Server-Side Storage** (simulated in this demo)
   - In a production environment, user data would be stored in a secure database
   - User accounts, including email and securely hashed passwords
   - Payment information (handled securely through PayPal)
   - Price alert settings

### For Administrators:

1. **Admin Authentication**
   - Login credentials: Email: `admin@example.com` / Password: `password`
   - Admin status is stored in localStorage after successful login

2. **Admin-Only Features**
   - SEO dashboard (only visible to admins)
   - Analytics dashboard
   - User management tools
   - Payment tracking

## How to Access Admin Features

1. **Login to Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to `/admin/login`
   - Use the demo credentials: Email: `admin@example.com` / Password: `password`

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - After login, you'll be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
   - Here you can view site statistics and performance metrics

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Access detailed analytics at `/admin/analytics`
   - View user engagement, popular cryptocurrencies, and conversion rates

4. **SEO Monitoring**
   - SEO widgets are automatically displayed for admin users throughout the site
   - A comprehensive SEO dashboard is available at `/admin/seo`

5. **Payment Management**
   - Track premium subscriptions at `/admin/payments`
   - View conversion rates and revenue statistics

## Data Persistence

In this demo version:
- User data persists only in the browser's localStorage and cookies
- Data is tied to the browser session and device
- No actual server-side storage is implemented

In a production environment:
- User data would be stored in a secure database
- Authentication would use JWT or similar tokens
- Premium subscriptions would be managed through a payment processor API
- Analytics would be tracked using a dedicated analytics service

## Privacy Considerations

- No personally identifiable information is collected in this demo
- In production, a privacy policy would outline data collection and usage
- User data would be encrypted both in transit and at rest
- GDPR and other privacy regulations would be followed for data collection and retention
