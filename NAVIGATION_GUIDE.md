## Navigation Troubleshooting

If you experience navigation issues:

1. **Ensure JavaScript is enabled** - The application relies on client-side JavaScript for navigation.

2. **Clear browser cache** - Occasionally, cached resources can cause navigation issues.

3. **Check for console errors** - Open your browser's developer tools to check for any JavaScript errors.

4. **Try direct URL access** - If clicking links doesn't work, try entering the URL directly in your browser's address bar.

## Navigation Fix Implementation

The CryptoTracker application has been updated with a comprehensive navigation fix that addresses client-side routing issues. The solution includes:

1. **Global Navigation Fix** - A `NavigationFix` component has been added to the root layout to automatically fix all internal links throughout the application.

2. **Direct URL Navigation** - All internal links now use direct URL navigation to ensure consistent behavior across the application.

3. **Navigation Helper** - A `navigateTo` function is available for programmatic navigation.

4. **Testing Tool** - A navigation test page is available at `/test-navigation` for administrators to verify that all links are working correctly. This page is restricted to admin users only.

5. **Reload the application** - A full page refresh can resolve many navigation issues.
