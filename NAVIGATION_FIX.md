# 🔄 NAVIGATION FIX IMPLEMENTED

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The navigation issue where clicking links redirected to the dashboard has been fixed. The following changes were made:

1. **Updated root page (`/`)** to properly display the landing page
2. **Fixed middleware** to prevent unwanted redirects
3. **Ensured proper routing** throughout the application

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

1. Push the changes to your repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix navigation issues redirecting to dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Deploy the updated version to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 🔍 Testing the Fix

After deployment, verify that:

1. The homepage (`/`) shows the landing page
2. Links work correctly without redirecting to the dashboard
3. Navigation between pages functions as expected

## 📝 Technical Details

The issue was caused by:

1. The root page (`/`) was using the same component as the dashboard
2. The middleware was potentially interfering with navigation

The fix ensures that:
1. The root page properly renders the landing page
2. The middleware only adds security headers without redirecting
