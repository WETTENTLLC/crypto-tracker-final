## Key Technologies Used

- **CoinGecko API**: Used for real-time cryptocurrency data
- **Recharts**: Implemented for interactive and responsive data visualization
- **Next.js**: Leveraged for efficient component rendering and API routes
- **MCP Framework**: Extended to support real-time data integration

## Benefits

1. **Real-Time Data**: Users now see actual cryptocurrency prices and market trends
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved dashboard with interactive charts and notifications
3. **Content Relevance**: Automated content generation now uses real market data
4. **Performance**: Optimized data fetching with proper error handling and loading states

## Deployment Instructions

The enhanced application can be deployed to Vercel using the existing deployment process:

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

No additional configuration is required as all new components are integrated with the existing MCP framework.

## Testing

After deployment, test the following functionality:

1. Verify real-time cryptocurrency prices are displayed correctly
2. Check that price charts show accurate historical data
3. Confirm market overview displays current global statistics
4. Test notification center for proper display and interaction
5. Validate that content generation endpoints return real market data
