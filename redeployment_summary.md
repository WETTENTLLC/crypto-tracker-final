# Analytics API Fix Redeployment Summary

## Deployment Information
- **Production URL**: https://crypto-tracker-no-modules-befhbaldu-wettentllcs-projects.vercel.app
- **Deployment Date**: May 23, 2025
- **Version**: 1.0.1 with Analytics API Fix

## Analytics API Fix Overview
The `/api/mcp/analytics` endpoint previously returned a 400 Bad Request error when called with POST requests containing event data. The issue has been fixed with this deployment.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Client-side code** was using both formats:
  - Some components were sending `event` as the event name field
  - Others were using `eventName` as expected by the server
- **Server-side code** in `route.ts` was strictly checking for `eventName` field only, rejecting requests with the `event` field

### Fix Implementation
1. **Modified the API route** to accept both `eventName` and `event` fields for backward compatibility
2. **Enhanced error messages** to provide clearer guidance when API calls fail
3. **Added additional logging** to help troubleshoot similar issues in the future

## Verification Results

All verification tests passed successfully:

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Legacy Format Test | ✅ PASSED | API accepts requests with `event` field |
| New Format Test | ✅ PASSED | API continues to work with `eventName` field |
| Data Retrieval Test | ✅ PASSED | GET endpoint correctly returns stored events |

## API Endpoints Status

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/mcp/content?type=market_update` | ✅ Good | Returns real-time market data |
| `/api/mcp/content?type=price_alert` | ✅ Good | Returns dynamic price alert content |
| `/api/mcp/content?type=trending_coins` | ✅ Good | Returns current trending coins |
| `/api/mcp/email-capture` | ✅ Good | Successfully captures email subscriptions |
| `/api/mcp/analytics` | ✅ Fixed | Now accepts both `event` and `eventName` fields |
| `/api/rss` | ✅ Good | Contains real-time cryptocurrency data with proper links |

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for any analytics-related errors in the Vercel logs for 24 hours
2. Consider standardizing all client-side components to use the `eventName` field in a future update
3. Implement schema validation in the API routes for more robust error handling
