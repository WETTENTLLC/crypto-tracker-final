# Analytics API Fix Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] Fix implemented and tested locally
- [x] Build process validated with `npm run build`
- [x] Verification script created
- [x] Documentation updated

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Login to Vercel if not already logged in
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Verify the Fix

After deployment completes, run the verification script:

```powershell
# From the project root directory
.\verify-analytics-fix.ps1
```

The script will test:
1. The API with legacy `event` field format
2. The API with new `eventName` field format
3. The ability to retrieve analytics data

### 3. Update Documentation

If the fix is confirmed working in production, update the following documents:
- `deployment_validation_checklist.md` - Change the analytics API status from ❌ to ✅
- `final_deployment_summary.md` - Note that the analytics API issue has been resolved

### 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring

Monitor the following for 24 hours after deployment:
- Vercel logs for any analytics-related errors
- User acquisition metrics to ensure data is being properly collected
- Client-side console errors in the browser dev tools

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist after deployment:

1. Roll back to previous version in Vercel dashboard
2. Investigate any new error messages or patterns
3. If necessary, implement a more comprehensive fix with additional testing

## Additional Notes

- This fix maintains backward compatibility with both field formats (`event` and `eventName`)
- The API now provides more descriptive error messages to aid troubleshooting
- Consider standardizing all client-side components on the `eventName` field in a future update
