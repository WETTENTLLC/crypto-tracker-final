# Post-Deployment Monitoring Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for monitoring and maintaining the Crypto Tracker application after deployment to Vercel. The application now includes real-time cryptocurrency data integration using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework.

## Monitoring Priorities

### 1. API Rate Limits

CoinGecko has rate limits that need to be monitored:

- **Free Tier**: 10-30 calls/minute
- **API Key**: 30-100 calls/minute

**Action Items:**
- Check Vercel function logs for any 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Implement additional caching if rate limits are being hit
- Consider upgrading to a paid CoinGecko plan if necessary

### 2. Real-Time Data Accuracy

Ensure cryptocurrency data displayed is accurate and up-to-date:

**Action Items:**
- Compare data with official sources (CoinGecko website)
- Verify timestamps on displayed data (should be within 5 minutes)
- Check for any missing data or display errors

### 3. Performance Metrics

Monitor application performance:

**Action Items:**
- Check Vercel Analytics for page load times
- Monitor API response times in function logs
- Verify server-side rendering is working correctly

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly Tasks

1. **API Health Check**
   - Test all API endpoints manually
   - Review Vercel function logs for errors
   - Verify data freshness

2. **Content Generation Review**
   - Check MCP content generation quality
   - Ensure market updates are relevant and accurate
   - Verify trending coins data is current

### Monthly Tasks

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Review and update npm packages
   - Check for CoinGecko API changes
   - Update any deprecated functionality

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review and optimize data fetching patterns
   - Improve caching strategies
   - Reduce unnecessary API calls

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Data Not Updating

1. Check CoinGecko API status
2. Verify API key is valid and not expired
3. Check rate limiting headers in responses
4. Review caching implementation

### Slow Dashboard Performance

1. Optimize component rendering
2. Implement more efficient data loading
3. Review and optimize chart components
4. Improve client-side caching

### MCP Content Generation Issues

1. Check error logs for content generation failures
2. Verify data sources are available
3. Test content generation endpoints directly
4. Review content formatting logic

## Scaling Considerations

As user base grows, consider:

1. Implementing a more robust caching layer
2. Moving to a dedicated cryptocurrency data provider
3. Adding a database for user preferences and settings
4. Implementing server-side caching for API responses
