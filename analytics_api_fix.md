# Analytics API Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The `/api/mcp/analytics` endpoint was returning a 400 Bad Request error when called with POST requests containing event data. The root cause was a mismatch in the field naming convention between the client-side code and the server-side implementation.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Client-side code** was using both formats:
  - Some components were sending `event` as the event name field
  - Others were using `eventName` as expected by the server
- **Server-side code** in `route.ts` was strictly checking for `eventName` field only, rejecting requests with the `event` field

## Solution Implemented
1. **Modified the API route** to accept both `eventName` and `event` fields for backward compatibility
2. **Enhanced error messages** to provide clearer guidance when API calls fail
3. **Added additional logging** to help troubleshoot similar issues in the future

## Changes Made
1. Updated `src/app/api/mcp/analytics/route.ts` to handle both field formats:
```typescript
// Before
const data = await request.json();
const { eventName, eventData } = data;

if (!eventName) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Event name is required' 
  }, { status: 400 });
}

// After
const data = await request.json();
// Handle both 'eventName' and legacy 'event' field for backwards compatibility
const eventName = data.eventName || data.event;
const eventData = data.eventData || data;

if (!eventName) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Event name is required (use eventName or event field)' 
  }, { status: 400 });
}
```

2. Enhanced error messaging:
```typescript
// Before
console.error('Error tracking analytics event:', error);
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: false, 
  error: 'Failed to track event' 
}, { status: 500 });

// After
console.error('Error tracking analytics event:', error);
console.error('Request body might be invalid. Expected format: { eventName: string, eventData?: object }');
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: false, 
  error: 'Failed to track event. Make sure to include eventName in your request.' 
}, { status: 500 });
```

## Verification Steps
1. Built the application successfully with `npm run build`
2. Tested the API locally with both field formats:
   - `event` field (legacy format): SUCCESS
   - `eventName` field (new format): SUCCESS
3. Created verification script `verify-analytics-fix.ps1` to test after deployment
4. Ready for deployment to Vercel

## Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy the updated codebase to Vercel using the standard deployment process
2. Run the verification script post-deployment to confirm the fix works in production
3. Monitor for any analytics-related errors in the Vercel logs for 24 hours

## Future Recommendations
1. Standardize on `eventName` field in all client-side components for consistency
2. Add schema validation to the API route to validate all incoming requests
3. Consider using TypeScript interfaces for request and response payloads
